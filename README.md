The occupancy management system is a system of cross-communicating electronic subsystems for monitoring and restricting the flow of people in a building and ensuring their safety and comfort. The system is able to give directions, warnings and recommendations to the visitors and occupants to ensure quick and bottleneck-free movement in and out of the building and provide safe levels of occupancy at all times.
